This is a continuation of the Udemy course Rust Programming Language for Beginners. This repository will include taking user input, conditional statements, loops, basic functions, tuples, and arrays in Rust. Details of these subjects will be broken out individually, with functional examples in the basics.rs file in this repository and the explanations here in the README.
